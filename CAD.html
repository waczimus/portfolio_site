        <p>the second module was about computer aided designing which taught us to design in 2d and 3d using softwares such as autocad and fusion 360.the first software that i was taught was fusion 360.fusion 360 is cloud based platform accessed through web browser.the data lives in the central location (the cloud) for ondemand access to system resources without user management and multi-platform communication.the second software was autocad,the basics were same as fusion 360 but there were some other resources like the command panel which made the usage more easy.both softwares were autodesk software and were used by benifiting from the educational license for student.</p>
