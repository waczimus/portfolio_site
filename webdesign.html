            <p>the html started on the first day where i was taught how to make a html web page.it was plain and simple no images nor color just a white page having "hello world!!!" written on it.after that progress began ,i went on w3school site to learn more about web design.the next day we were taught css basics.</p>

            <p>the css or cascading style sheets was used to make my plain looking website to get looking good and showing a interface where a user can actually use it.we were able to create a card showcasing our own info on it.it was'n just a plain paragraph or heading it looked like a card.the next session was on javascript</p>

            <p>after the css workshop i was taught on how to use javascript i.e loops , conditional statements ,how to code on console and i tried to make a calcy using it.it was a simple calcy using only 3 numbers and can only do only addition and substraction.i haven't included any of the javascript in this portfolio site and made solely on the basis of html and css</p>

            <p>after completing all the three session on html, css and javascript,i was taught on how to upload my projects globally so that i can view the from anywhere,or how to host them  in a site format.for this purpose i was taught git and github.git is a version control system which can keep track of all the changes i have made to all the existing files on the hosted site.github is the place where i was able to host my site for first time . </p>
