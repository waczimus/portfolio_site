        <h2>Subject : Report on computer aided cutting course that is module three of the Fab-lab course.</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>The third module contained the guides for operating a laser cutting machine and the necessary input to be provided to it.
            The image to be provide to the software must be an svg or vector images , they can be scaled with high quality.
            The software used are inkscape,fusion 360,autocad,freecad,etc. I used fusion 360 as it was confortable for me to work with.
            Designing was to be done considering factors such as kerf, which depends upon the material type. the kerf is the amount of material burned away when using laser.
            To provide the input to the laser cutter we used laser cad software. 
            <br><br>
            The computer aided cutting also included the use of cnc machines for the cutting purpose. Depending upon the type of job these type of machines are to be selected.
            The machines needed to be programmed in g-code and m-code and the program is then provided to the machine. The tools used are of different sizes and shapes and can be changed according to need.
            These machines are to be used for 3d objects such as cylinders ,cubes,etc.
